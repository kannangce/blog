This is one thing that I noticed. Then tried proving it, the below is the proof.

There is a proof that we can get through binary.

Take the RHS and express it in binary,
The binary of


`1` is `1`
`2` is `10`
`4` is `100`
.
.

In the same way, `(2^n)-1` is `100..(n-1)0’s`


So when I express the sum `1+2+4+…2^(n-1)` as binary,
I’ll get `1111...` (n-1 1’s)

Now consider the RHS,

`111...`(n-1 1’s) + 1

So adding 1 at the last will keeps giving a 1 carried to its preceding position.
And at last you’ll get `100....`(n 0’s)

Which when expressed in decimal is `2^n`
That’s it..:-)
