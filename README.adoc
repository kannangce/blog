# About:

Contains the content of my http://kannangce.in[blog].

- This contains the blog contents under link:content[content] folder.
- The pages are generated using the https://github.com/getpelican/pelican[pelican] static site generator.
- This site uses https://github.com/kannangce/graymill[graymill] template, which is embedded as submodule in this project.


## Pre-requisite to build:

- We need `python`/`pip`, in which the pelican is built.
- Install pelican using `pip3 install pelican`.
- Since the content is written in asciidoc, to convert into Html, we need https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor[`asciidoctor`] utility, which need to be installed(`brew install asciidoctor`) in the machine that builds.

## Build:

`make html` - To generate the html out of the adocs under the link:content[content] folder.
